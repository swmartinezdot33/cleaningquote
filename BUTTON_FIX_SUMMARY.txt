                    BUTTON TEXT CUTOFF FIX - COMPLETED
================================================================================

ISSUE FIXED:
- Button text was being cut off when the form was embedded in an iframe
- This occurred because of 'overflow-hidden' and fixed height constraints
- Affecting narrow viewports (like embedded iframes on third-party sites)

CHANGES MADE:
File: /src/app/page.tsx (Lines 2586-2629)

1. HEIGHT: h-48 → min-h-48 (and all breakpoints)
   - Allows buttons to expand vertically
   - Adapts to multi-line text content

2. OVERFLOW: Removed 'overflow-hidden'
   - Allows text to display fully
   - No more clipping or text cutoff

3. LINE HEIGHT: leading-snug → leading-tight
   - Better spacing for wrapped text
   - More readable multi-line content

4. PADDING: Adjusted px-1 sm:px-2
   - More space for text on mobile
   - Better responsive behavior

5. INNER CONTENT: Removed 'overflow-hidden' from both states
   - Selected and unselected buttons now display full content
   - Consistent behavior across all states

TESTING RESULTS:
✅ Build completed successfully
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ No CSS class issues
✅ No linting violations
✅ All pages render correctly
✅ Production ready

BEFORE & AFTER:
